# Todo Microservices Infrastructure on Azure

This project demonstrates end-to-end infrastructure provisioning
for a Todo microservices application using Terraform and Azure DevOps CI/CD.

## Problem Statement

Manual infrastructure setup is time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult
to maintain across multiple environments.
This project solves the problem by using Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
and automated CI/CD pipelines on Azure.
